About The Project
This portfolio was designed to be more than just a static page; it's an interactive experience. The goal was to blend a clean, modern aesthetic with dynamic animations to create a memorable impression. It's built with performance, accessibility, and professional design principles in mind.

Key Features
Dynamic Hero Section: A "Matrix" style digital rain animation creates an immersive background.

Interactive Elements:

3D flipping cards for detailed project views.

Hover-activated animations on skills and social media icons.

Smooth User Experience:

Scroll-triggered fade-in animations for all content sections.

Active navigation highlighting that tracks your position on the page.

Fully Responsive: A seamless experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices, complete with a functional "hamburger" menu for smaller screens.

Functional Contact Form: Integrated with Formspree to receive messages directly to my email.

Accessibility & Performance: Optimized with best practices like lazy image loading, accessible aria-labels, and efficient requestAnimationFrame for animations.

Tech Stack
This project was built using core web technologies, with a focus on clean, modern code.

HTML5: For the semantic structure of the site.

Tailwind CSS: For the utility-first styling and responsive design framework.
